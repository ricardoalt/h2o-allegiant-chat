name: sub-discipline-router
description: Decompose a waste opportunity into its distinct sub-streams and route each to the correct specialist lens (solids, aqueous liquids, organic liquids, sludges, gases / vapours, containerised / lab-pack), then recompose the specialist analyses into one coherent picture. Trigger at the start of every new opportunity, before deep classification or routing, and again whenever new input reveals an additional phase or fraction previously missed (e.g. "we also have a tanker of caustic alongside the catalyst"). Also trigger whenever the user describes a multi-phase, multi-container, or site-wide opportunity (refinery visit, decommissioning, lab clearout, manufacturing turnaround), or whenever a single stream description implies more than one management approach is plausible. Produce an explicit decomposition table, assign a specialist lens per sub-stream, and coordinate the specialists — don't let the agent default to treating a portfolio as one stream. Prefer this over jumping straight into analysis.

# Sub-discipline router

A single opportunity is rarely a single stream. Refinery visits produce solids, sludges, liquids, and cylinders in one conversation. Decommissioning yields a mixed inventory. A lab clearout is dozens of sub-streams under one customer. The router's job is to notice this before anyone downstream tries to squeeze a portfolio into a single lens.

## Run this first

Run on every new opportunity, before specialist-lens-light, before commercial-shaping, before reporting. Re-run whenever new input surfaces a sub-stream you previously missed — e.g., the producer mentions "we also have a tanker of caustic alongside the catalyst" halfway through the conversation.

## What to produce

A decomposition table — one row per distinct sub-stream. The fields:

```
| # | Sub-stream name | Phase        | Origin process        | Approx quantity | Specialist lens         | Cross-links |
|---|-----------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Spent FCC catalyst | solid     | FCC regenerator          | ~20 t, one-time  | solids-specialist        | —           |
| 2 | Spent sulfidic caustic | aq. liq | Merox extractor       | ~15,000 gal recur | aqueous-liquids-spec.    | 3 (shared hydrocarbons) |
| 3 | Slop oil               | org. liq | Process slops          | 2,000–4,000 gal  | organic-liquids-spec.    | 2, 4 (shared aromatics) |
| 4 | Tank-bottom sludge     | sludge   | Crude tank cleanout    | ~8 drums          | sludges-specialist       | 3           |
| 5 | Lab / maintenance drums | lab-pack | Lab and shop cleanout | 12 drums, mixed   | containerised-labpack   | —           |
```

## How to identify sub-streams

A sub-stream is any part of the opportunity that would be analysed, routed, or managed differently from another part. Differences that justify decomposition:

- **Physical phase** — solid, aqueous liquid, organic liquid, sludge, gas, mixed. A tanker and a drum pallet are different sub-streams even if the producer describes them together.
- **Origin process** — even for the same phase, different origin processes produce different specifications. Merox spent caustic and ethylene spent caustic are both "spent caustic" and should be different rows.
- **Generator frequency** — a one-time inventory item is commercially different from a recurring stream.
- **Containerisation** — a bulk liquid in a tank is different from the same liquid in drums. The handling paths diverge.
- **Regulatory frame** — if one fraction is PCB-regulated (TSCA) and another is RCRA-regulated, they are different sub-streams.
- **Monetisation path** — if two streams have different plausible outlets (reuse vs disposal), they are different sub-streams.

When in doubt, decompose. You can always consolidate later; you cannot retroactively de-merge a conflated analysis.

## Specialist lens assignment

Every sub-stream gets exactly one primary lens, even if it touches multiple. The six lenses:

- **solids-specialist** — spent catalyst, contaminated soil, filter cake, foundry sands, ash, crushable solids, soot.
- **aqueous-liquids-specialist** — spent acids, spent caustics, process water, rinsate, cooling-tower blowdown.
- **organic-liquids-specialist** — solvents, waste oils, slop oil, off-spec fuels, distillation fractions.
- **sludges-specialist** — tank bottoms, API separator sludge, DAF float, paint sludge, refinery sludges (K-series listings apply).
- **gases-vapours-specialist** — compressed gas cylinders, aerosols, refrigerants, lab gas drums.
- **containerised-labpack-specialist** — mixed drums, lab packs, university or school cleanouts, unknown orphans.

Assign by the dominant phase and by the management paradigm that fits best. A drum of mixed lab chemicals goes to labpack even if some contents are organic liquids — because it will be managed as a lab-pack, not as bulk solvents.

## Cross-links matter

Two sub-streams can share evidence, share risk, or share routing implications. Capture these in the cross-links column.

Examples:
- Spent caustic and slop oil from the same refinery likely share hydrocarbon species — if BTEX is measured in one, the composition inference carries to the other.
- Spent catalyst and tank-bottom sludge from the same unit may share pyrophoric-iron-sulfide risk.
- Aqueous and organic fractions of an API separator output are the same origin — splitting them at the point of decomposition must preserve that.

Cross-links drive shared analytical plans. A shared BTEX analysis on a composite can cover two sub-streams at once — that is a commercial saving that shows up later in the gap list.

## How the router coordinates

After decomposition:

1. For each sub-stream, hand off to the assigned specialist lens (specialist-lens-light in Discovery mode; full specialist in Assessment).
2. Shared evidence and cross-linked questions propagate back to the router, which then reassembles the specialist outputs into a unified opportunity view.
3. The recomposition is the input to `commercial-shaping`, which sizes and positions the whole opportunity, and to `discovery-reporting`, which produces the three tiers.

Recomposition is not just concatenation. Identify:
- **Shared analytical plan items** — "one BTEX sweep covers sub-streams 2 and 3."
- **Shared safety risks** — pyrophoric risk in spent catalyst implies same risk class in tank-bottom sludge from the same unit.
- **Shared logistics constraints** — if all sub-streams are at one site, a joint manifest and single-day pickup may apply.
- **Sub-stream interdependencies** — one sub-stream may be a feedstock or contaminant of another.

## What to do with single-stream opportunities

Run the router anyway. A one-row decomposition table is still a useful output — it confirms that the opportunity is genuinely one sub-stream, and the assigned lens is explicit. The downstream skills expect the router's output as a given; skipping it because "there's only one stream" is how multi-phase opportunities get missed.

## Worked example — refinery portfolio

Input: "We just visited Baytown. They have spent FCC catalyst (about 20 tonnes one-off, clearing a vessel), ongoing merox spent caustic (around 15,000 gallons a week), slop oil in the process tank farm (2,000–4,000 gallons sitting), tank-bottom sludge from a crude tank cleanout (around 8 drums), and about a dozen drums of lab and maintenance miscellany."

Decomposition:

```
| # | Sub-stream                    | Phase     | Origin                    | Qty                | Lens                       | Cross-links |
|---|-------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Spent FCC catalyst            | solid     | FCC regenerator            | ~20 t, one-off     | solids-specialist           | 4 (pyroph.) |
| 2 | Merox spent caustic           | aq. liq.  | Merox extractor            | ~15,000 gal/wk rec | aqueous-liquids-spec.       | 3 (BTEX)    |
| 3 | Slop oil                      | org. liq. | Process slops              | 2k–4k gal, ad-hoc  | organic-liquids-spec.       | 2, 4 (BTEX) |
| 4 | Crude tank-bottom sludge      | sludge    | Crude tank cleanout        | ~8 drums, one-off  | sludges-specialist          | 1, 3        |
| 5 | Lab / maintenance drums       | lab-pack  | Lab + shop cleanout        | ~12 drums, one-off | containerised-labpack       | —           |
```

Cross-link notes: "Sub-streams 2, 3, 4 likely share hydrocarbon species (BTEX) — a composite BTEX sweep covers three sub-streams. Sub-streams 1 and 4 may share pyrophoric iron sulfide risk if sulfided catalyst present — specialist safety review on each."

This decomposition is now the agenda for specialist-lens-light (or full specialist in Assessment).

## What this skill never does

- **Does not classify.** Phase, origin, and lens assignment. No RCRA codes, no characteristic determinations.
- **Does not size or position.** That is commercial-shaping. The router tells commercial-shaping what there is to size.
- **Does not reject sub-streams.** Even clearly unviable sub-streams get a row, a lens, and a flag — the decision not to pursue is a commercial decision, not a router decision.
- **Does not second-guess the producer.** If they describe a stream as "spent caustic" and the SDS says otherwise, the router captures both and hands the conflict to sds-interpretation and safety-flagging to resolve.
